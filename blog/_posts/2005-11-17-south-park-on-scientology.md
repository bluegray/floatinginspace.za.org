Just saw [the latest episode of South Park][1] about Scientology (912 - Trapped in the Closet). This is another great episode that pokes fun at the really ridiculous ideas that are accepted as fact by some people. And the best (or scariest) part is that they didn't have to *make up anything*. I'm glad that there are still some people in the media that are not afraid to take on pseudo religious groups and expose them for what they really are. You shouldn't be afraid of offending people or getting sued for speaking the truth, which seems to be the norm these days.

Scientologists are especially quick to sue, just Google and you won't believe the lengths they go to.  
I wonder who they're gonna sue now - all the credits for the episode went to Jane/John Smith ;)

Just a pity this episode will not air here for a long time - those damn creepy dianetics peddlers in the malls won't go away...
