There is a problem with the Gadget if you have the [Customize Google][3] firefox extension installed. The 'Anonymize Google UID' setting will cause problems when trying to log in. For some reason, if you open the gadget in the sidebar however, this is not a problem...

Edit: The developer of the extension fixed the problem. Everything is working fine now.
