Struggled with ffmpeg trying to re-encode an old video. Got this error:  
`Incorrect aspect ratio specification.`  
Then realized ffmpeg doesn't like floats when used with a colon as parameter for `-aspect`.  
Using `-aspect 2.42` or `-aspect 242:100` is fine, but `-aspect 2.42:1` is not. :/  
Doh!
