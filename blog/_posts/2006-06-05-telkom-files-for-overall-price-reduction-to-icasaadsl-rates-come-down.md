[Telkom files for overall price reduction to ICASA....ADSL rates come down! - MyADSL][1]

Really? It amazes me how Telkom always manages to reduce prices in such a way that there is almost no cost savings to the customer in the end. Big deal, so some people are going to save R20 to R50 a month on ADSL. It is still more than ~R250 for the entry level 192 kbps line rental. That is R250 more than it should be. There is still outrageous bandwidth prices and caps. ADSL still will cost you more than ~R500 a month and it will still be only 192 kbps and a 3GB cap.

People that can afford ADSL will now pay less, but those who can't afford it will still be without a decent internet connection. That is not real progress.

ISP's will also not benefit from these reductions.

Good thing it's only proposed reductions...
