Something amusing \[found here\](http://randi.org/jr/2006-02/021006busted.html#i7 "Randi commentary snippet")

> For several years, some friends and I have had a regular Wednesday morning coffee date at a lovely little neighborhood cafe and bookstore. The coffee was excellent, and the conversation even better. Recently though, the cafe was purchased and remodeled by a "fluff and nonsense" practitioner, who stocked the shelves with books like "Indigo Children," "Awakening Your Psychic Powers," and a certain fictional work by one Kevin Trudeau... She also offered palm, tarot and tea leaf readings to the paying customers.  
>  
> Unfortunately, in her quest to provide alternative and occult reading material to patrons of the cafe, the proprietor completely forgot to provide reasonable coffee. It became almost undrinkable; truly nasty, bitter stuff. My friends and I were forced to find an alternative meeting place farther away, but with palatable coffee.  
>  
> On our last day at the old cafe, I noticed the owner trot to the back storage room with an empty water jug. She returned with it brimming, and used it to make a fresh batch of coffee. I wondered if the source of the water could be the source of the horrible coffee, so after she was out of sight, I tip-toed into the storage room and looked around. What I saw was a standard 20-liter water jug, inverted over a normal water dispenser and cooler. The only odd thing was that the jug was covered with brightly colored sticky notes. I crept closer for a better look, and saw that on every sticky note was a positive, uplifting word, printed in bright felt pen, Ã  la Masaru Emoto!  
>  
> Among these powerful words were: "Beauty," "Health,â€ "Happiness," "Love," "Joy," and even "Crystal." One, lone, pink sticky note stood out from its peers, though, and when I saw it, I knew I had discovered the secret to the lousy coffee. It was all abundantly clear at that moment; on that curling, pink note, carefully printed with blue felt pen, was one word: "PAECE."

> Evidently, Emoto neglected to mention that water is highly sensitive to bad spelling...
