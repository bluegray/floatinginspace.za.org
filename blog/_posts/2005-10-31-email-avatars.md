After using sylpheed-claws for ages, I decided to give Thunderbird a try. Last time I used it, I didn't like it, can't remember why. This time it's better - it's starting to grow on me ;)  
One thing that never caught on is x-face in emails, which sylpheed supports. [Messagefaces is a cool plugin][1] that adds x-face, face and gravatar images support in Thunderbird. That is one of the reasons I decided to try TB again. [Gravatar images][2] is also an interesting idea which is mainly for blogs, but fits in nicely with email as well.  
The TB plugin also allows you to use custom images for different users.
