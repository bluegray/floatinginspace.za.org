I read the [skeptic article on the Shermer and Chopra debate][1] today. It was a nice  
change from the usual manner in which these kind of discussions usually occur.  
If only more crackpots could follow Chopra and think more carefully before they say  
something and present their views clearly. But as usual for non-skeptic types - this is not completely  
without half truths, exaggeration and plainly missing the point. While he seems to agree that there are frauds out there that need debunking, he does not mention how he would do it. Without skepticism and questioning doubtful claims I can't really see what tools he would use to differentiate truth from lies. But then - he is not too concerned with the practical implementation of his ideas it would seem.

1. Chopra says he has "rarely met a skeptic who didn't use ad hominem attacks",  
which is itself an ad hominem attack - or maybe I don't understand the term.  
2. "Skeptics generally leap to the conclusion that I am naive, self-deluded, or simply unread in the sciences."  
I'm guilty there - He certainly can make a good point.  
3. "Skeptics rarely examine the shaky assumptions of their own position."  
Which is also true of believers - even more so. Anyway, a good skeptic would not make shaky assumptions, and  
would admit it if he did.  
4. "Skeptics believe that doubt is a positive attribute."  
It might not be positive - but it is necessary when you want to find the truth.  
"...although most come off as self-important petty naysayers who try everyoneâ€™s patience"  
As long as they make a good point. Whether they are pleasant or not is not relevant.  
5. "Worst of all, skeptics take pride in defending the status quo and condemn the kind of open-minded inquiry that  
peers into the unknown."  
Again this is not a true skeptic - Shermer puts it best: â€œExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidenceâ€ and  
â€œKeep an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.â€

It would seem that Chopra has a really skewed view of skeptics and what they stand for - but maybe that is to be expected.

Shermer's reply is much more difficult to poke holes into - so I'll have to  
sleep on it. What I did like is the bible verses he quotes. It might be a cheap  
stunt, but it does demonstrate that he is not as close minded as the skeptics  
Chopra seems to be dealing with.
