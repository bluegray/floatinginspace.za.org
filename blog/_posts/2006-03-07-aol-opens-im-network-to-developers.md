\[AOL Opens IM Network to Developers\](http://www.commentwire.com/article_news.asp?guid=885D38AB-7875-4A51-9BDF-86B79F8B58A6)

This is obviously in response to GTalk's shakeup of the IM world. But it is a bit restrictive and a bit too late I think. You can only use Open AIM if your client doesn't have too many users and you are not allowed to support other IM networks. Who in their right mind will choose AIM for such an application if there is something open like jabber around. Not to mention that Gaim/trillian/jabber are perfectly able to use the AIM protocol anyway without any help from AOL for years now.
