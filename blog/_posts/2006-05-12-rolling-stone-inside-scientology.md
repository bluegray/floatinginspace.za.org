[Rolling Stone : Inside Scientology][1] 

 [1]: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology

It's always funny when you read about silly people with silly notions, and that is how I felt when I started reading that article. But if you read until the end, you will realize that this "church" is messing with real people and real emotions. It is not harmless. There are people that clearly benefit from the the work of others.  
That is not freedom.
