A nice firefox extension I found today is [linkification][1]. It converts all text links that are not clickable to clickable links.  
One of the features is that you can change the appearance of the link to distinguish it from other links. You can do this by either selecting colors in the preference dialog or you can use the linkification-ext class in your custom  
userContent.css file. For more on the userContent.css file, see the [page on Mozilla config files ][2] or [Mozilla's customization page][3]

For example, if you put

.linkification-ext {  
text-decoration: underline overline !important ;  
color: pink !important;  
}  
in your userContent.css file the links would look like this:
