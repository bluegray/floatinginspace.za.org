[Tutorial - Fix most Joystick problems - K700, K750][1]

 [1]: http://www.esato.com/board/viewtopic.php?topic=125703

At last, this anoying joystick problem I had with my SonyEricsson K700i is a thing of the past. I cleaned out the region around the joystick before, and it did help, but I didn't try this more aggressive approach. I actually didn't have one of those spray cleaner cans, but I poured some alcohol cleaning solution over the joystick and blew it clean. Just watch out for your screen though. But my joystick is almost perfect again ;)

It was just dirty after all.
