Been listening to the soundtrack for the new Spiderman movie this weekend. With so many of my favourite bands on there, I had to ;)

Flaming Lips, YYYs, Snow Patrol \*and\* The Killers. What's the chance? The songs aren't that bad, but the ones I enjoy most are from Wolfmother, Black Mountain, The Oohlas and The Walkmen (which I never heard of before). So all in all, a good album.
