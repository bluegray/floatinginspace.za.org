It recently snowed in Johannesburg for the first time in 26 years. I was 4 years old the last time it snowed there.  
I have a lot of memories from early childhood but that one stands out as one of the more detailed ones. I can remember the snowman we built, my mother being pregnant and a woman that was stuck in our yard with her volksie. But I never realized that I was only 4 years old when it happened until now -- for some reason I felt older when thinking back to that day. Maybe because I'm thinking now with an older brain, an older sense of myself. 

I wonder how old I'll be in my memories the next time it snows in Joburg...
