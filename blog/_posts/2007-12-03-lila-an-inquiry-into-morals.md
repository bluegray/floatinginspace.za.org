Just finished the book *[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals][1]*. A definite must read. If you've read Pirsig's first book, you will know what to expect, but I liked this one even more. It's somehow more practical and provides a fresh view on the big questions in life.

But it is difficult to read. Well, I suppose it's not a simple subject, and his meticulous exploration of every detail is necessary. And that is partly what I like about his books as well. It's not just some easy to read feel good book, that provides you with feel good catch phrases on a plate. You reason with the author, exploring and following his train of thought from beginning to end. 

Unfortunately this is why many people will not read this book. Even though it provides much more than just a rehash of new age values (like the recent *The Secret*) it is not as accessible. You have to dig a little.
