![greatest 1-day cricket game ever][1] 
Wow, what a great game. I still can't stop smiling :D

You can [read some interesting comments here][2]. No cricket supporter in South Africa or Australia will forget this game soon.

I remember the feeling after our losing matches in the last world cup. I called Hlia right after and we shared our disappointment. How I wish I could share this great feeling now.  
Hlia, This one's for you!
