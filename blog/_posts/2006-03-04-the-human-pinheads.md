\*Sigh\*, here we go again.  
The Human Pin Code.  
Another scam artist/delusional pleb trying to use 'science' to make money from uninformed people.  
This is not a new concept - it is just presented in a new way.

Note the word 'code', a very lucrative word these days. Think Da Vinci code, bible code etc. etc.  
It is also very convenient if you claim to have the key to that code, because then you can charge people huge sums of money for that key.

Luckily someone already wrote a very nice critique about it to expose this for the fallacy it is.

* Pythagoras' Octagon Theorem - bah, no such thing.  
* Extraordinary hyperbole and even more extraordinary claims - plenty  
* Only relying on the authority of people with the right credentials - obviously  
* Real scientific evidence - None

In short everything pseudoscience is al about. A dubious claim dressed up with science. All you need to do is lift the curtain and look behind the window dressing to find that it is just another astrology/numerology concept presented in a more "scientific" way.

It is sad though that many people don't look behind the pretty exterior, or are unable to seperate pseudoscience from real science. It is their money that will be wasted, while this douche get richer.
