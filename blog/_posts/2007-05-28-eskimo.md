Beautiful lyrics... even better song.

>Tiredness fuels empty thoughts  
>I find myself disposed  
>Brightness fills empty space  
>In search of inspiration  
>Harder now with higher speed  
>Washing in on top of me  
>So I look to my eskimo friend  
>I look to my eskimo friend  
>I look to my eskimo friend  
>When I'm down, down, down. 

>Rain it wets muddy roads  
>I find myself exposed  
>Tapping doors, but irritate  
>In search of destination  
>Harder now with higher speed  
>Washing in on top of me  
>So I look to my eskimo friend  
>I look to my eskimo friend  
>I look to my eskimo friend  
>When I'm down, down, down. 

>kosketa minua (Touch me)  
>Ã¤lÃ¤ kÃ¤sillÃ¤si (Not with your hands)  
>vaan niin ettÃ¤ tunnen sinut (But the way I can feel you) 

>kosketa minua (Touch me)  
>Ã¤lÃ¤ kÃ¤sillÃ¤si (Not with your hands)  
>mutta sielussasi (But within your soul) 

>minÃ¤ kaipaan eskimo-ystÃ¤vÃ¤Ã¤ni (I look to my eskimo friend)

>When I'm down, down, down.  
>When I'm down, down, down.  
>When I'm down, down, down.
