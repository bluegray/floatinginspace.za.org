From : 

> Brian Herlihy, SEACOM president, said that the idea behind the cable is to offer international bandwidth at a lower price but to increase usage to ensure profits. 
> 
> In a move seldom experienced in the local telecoms arena, SEACOM revealed their wholesale pricing structure and strategy to the media. 
> 
> The company will have a four tiered bandwidth pricing approach where bandwidth prices for larger products, in this case STM-64, STM-16 and STM-4 connections, are sold at reduced rates to the standard STM-1 connection. 
> 
> Their price for an STM-1 connection however sets a roof for the resale of bandwidth by larger bulk-bandwidth buyers thereby ensuring that smaller players receive a competitive rate. 
> 
> The price for an STM-64 connection, supplying 9.6 Gbps of bandwidth, is $ 1 663 875 or R 267-00 per Mbps per month. The price per Mbps per month for a STM-1 (155 Mbps) service is R 673-00 while a STM-4 (600 Mbps) connection costs R 575-00 and a STM-16 (2.5 Gbps) service will cost R 435-00. 

or in other words:

STM-1 (155 Mbps)

R673 per Mbps per month

STM-4 (600 Mbps)

R575 per Mbps per month

STM-16 (2500 Mbps)

R435 per Mbps per month

STM-64 (9600 Mbps)

R267 per Mbps per month

As I understand it, this means the cost for an always on 128 KB/s connection will cost between R267 and R673 per month, but we still don't know the contention ratio, so I can't speculate too much. 

Certainly good news though, but I'll wait to see the actual cost to the end consumer before I start jumping for joy. Only the bigger ISP's will be able to afford STM-64, although, considering the current cost of bandwidth, STM-1 will be far less than the current offerings anyway. 

At least we have a specific date and pricing this time. Hopefully change is more imminent now than the imminent change promised by DoC in the past...
