[Is Google Calling Gaim's Shots?][1]  
This article goes a bit far with it's speculations, no doubt for a more catchy headline. Read more in [this blog][2] and [here][3]  
Just normal disagreement between developers in a OS project. Not the first and certainly not the last. I expect the main reason for the disagreements is because voice support need to happen soon. Using gaim-vv might have it's advantages, but it is not complete yet. From a user's perspective, I'd like to see voice support for linux as soon as possible. And that is why Google is paying Sean, isn't it? Personally I don't care for video calls that much anyway ;)  
I'm sure everything will be sorted out in the end. Gaim-vv is certainly not killed off - maybe set aside. Hmm.
