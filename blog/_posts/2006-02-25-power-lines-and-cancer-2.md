I heard someone say this week that it was proven that power lines cause cancer. Apparently not.  
from \[Bob Park's What's New\](http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn053102.html "Bob Park's What's New")

> **EMF: CALIFORNIA PREPARES TO RESURRECT THE POWER LINE SCARE.**  
> It's been more than 20 years since it was first claimed that power lines induce cancer. In 1995 the APS Council stated that such conjectures "have not been scientifically substantiated" (). A year later, the National Academy of Sciences concluded the same thing ([WN 1 Nov 96][1]). In 1997, a National Cancer Institute epidemiological study found no detectable EMF/cancer link ([WN 4 Jul 97][2]). Not a single lawsuit based on health effects of EMF has ever succeeded. Yet, California's Department of Health Services, inexplicably turned to three obscure scientists in the Department to "review" EMF studies. Without any new evidence, the three "are inclined to believe that EMFs can cause some degree of increased risk of childhood leukemia, adult brain cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease and miscarriage." Their review has not yet been released to the public. When it is, it will start this whole thing up again.
