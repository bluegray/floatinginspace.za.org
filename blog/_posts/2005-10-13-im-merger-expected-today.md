[IM  
merger expected today - vnunet.com][1]  
Nice to see something happening. No doubt this is in response to Google's  
increased threat over Microsoft. Even if Google fails miserably - at least they  
can claim to be the bit of a kickstart the IM arena needed for some time now.  
Hopefully it won't be long for IM to be standardised so I can drop the million  
IM addresses I have ;)
