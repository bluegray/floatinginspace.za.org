As a regular Special Assignment viewer I'm generally very impressed by the presentation and the level of investigation in most of the programs.  
I must say though that I was dismayed at the lack of proper investigation on the program about cell masts. It is clear that they should stick to social and political issues because when it comes to informing the public on scientific issues they are miserably failing. But of course that is not their goal. They just report news worth stories.

This is a very important and sensitive issue and will certainly become even more important as more people take advantage of wireless technology. It will not be solved by reporting anecdotal stories and speculating about things without understanding the issues involved.

There are no evidence that suggest radiation within the approved levels are dangerous.  
There was as far as I could tell no effort made to investigate other causes for the ill effects the people in the program experienced.  
There was no mention of checks on the cell towers to make sure they are operating within safe limits.  
There was no mention of why cell towers are making buzzing sounds or even if the buzzing sounds are from the microwave transmitters.  
With the number of cell phone towers in the world, why are there only one family that turned grey?

I find it amusing that one of the 'experts' were a homeopath. Other than the cell phone radiation issue, homeopathy does have a lot of research proving that it is only as effective as the placebo effect. 

The placebo effect of living next to a cell tower will now have to be neutralized by the placebo effect from an expensive 'hi tech' (magnetic) pendant on a chain. :| :? :roll:
