[Some good news from Gaim.][1]  
This makes sense. Google stated that they wanted to use open standards and be inter operable between different clients/protocols. As Gaim have been doing this for some time now, they are the people to help do this. As I said before - most of the tools to unify IM and standardize the business has been around for a while now. The user base and resources Google can bring to the table is just what is needed to make this happen.
