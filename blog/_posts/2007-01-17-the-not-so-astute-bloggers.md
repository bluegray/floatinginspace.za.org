[THE [not so] ASTUTE BLOGGERS: Whites Must Suffer Racial Abuse Without Retort][1]  
> At a cricket match in South Africa recently, Pakistani (Muslim) spectators were hurling racial abuse at white members of the South African team. One of the white players, Herschelle Gibbs, uttered some racial abuse in return. He did not shout it but spoke it just loudly enough for his team-mates only to hear. For such wickedness, he has now been punished by a ban from the game for two matches.
Lol, some people darrem ;)

So I posted the following comment:  
> This reminds me of an old joke:  
> Jan and Koos go to their first rugby test, All Blacks vs. Springbokke. When the players run onto the field, Koos turns to Jan with a surprised expression on his face and says: "Maar hulle is dan nie swart nie"
They didn't find it that funny, because they deleted my comment. Maybe they didn't get the joke? (hint: Gibbs is also not black ;) )

ok ok, maybe it's not funny.
