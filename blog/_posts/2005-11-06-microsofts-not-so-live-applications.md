[Pitiful  
spectacle of an old DOS trying to do new tricks][1].  
Seems that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, not good tricks anyway. It  
would be interesting to see if/how Microsoft evolves in the future. But if  
these live apps are an indication, they better rethink their strategy. A quick  
search led to these  
[web  
based office apps][2]. Not quite an office suit, but  
[Writely][3] seems pretty good. You can upload or email word docs to edit and save them back in word or html format. It can also be used for blogging - I am writing this in writely ;)  
Nobody knows what [Sun and Google are up to yet][4], but many people expect some sort of office suit based on [openoffice][5].
