[If you do this with Google Talk][1], you can use your gmail address to chat to everyone on yahoo/msn/icq. [This has been possible for a long time with jabber][2], but now that [Gtalk is also part of the public XMPP network][3], you can use your gmail address and you don't need another jabber account. Cool :D

You can use psi or exodus - both are excellent jabber clients. Gaim does not support transport registering, so you can't use that to register with the other transports/services, but you can use it to chat once you've registered.

Now you can email and chat to almost anybody from the Gmail interface.  
That is how you take over the world ;)
