So I wondered what movies were showing at the Neelsie (local student center) this week. To my surprise, there is a film fest called *Exploring Consciousness*.

Hmm sounds interesting.  
Or maybe not.

**What The Bleep Do We Know?**  
..."an almost fantastic 'Alice in Wonderland' adventure, revealing the world of quantum physics hidden behind what we consider to be our waking reality."

Sounds good, but not after you read \[this review by Richard Dawkins and other scientists\](http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1484925,00.html#article_continue) that should understand more about the science behind the film than most people.

**ONE the Movie**

"Life's ultimate questions answered by christians, buddhists, muslims, jews, atheists, philosophers, mystics, monks and more."

Shouldn't the movie be titled "FORTY TWO" then ;)  
Maybe I'll go see this one.

**Circle Chasers**

"A film about the sheer beauty and symbols of crop circles that appeared in Wiltshire in 2004."

Do people still think aliens make these crop circles - \[well they didn't\](http://www.circlemakers.org/totc2004.html).

**My Hare Krishna Family**

"Frank Opperman explores the themes of religion/relationships through the life of of his sister.

This looks like the most interesting film of the bunch - I'll go have a look.

It's a pity all these shows are R20, because some of them are short movies, and while some may be interesting, they are not worth R20.
